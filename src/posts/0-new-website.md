# Why the change?

Well, I felt like it, basically. I initially used docusaurus because I wanted my page to be usable in some way, but I didn't have time to actually sit down and write one.

Now, although basic, I've written a somewhat functional website using SvelteKit.

# Why SvelteKit?

I've toyed with it in the past and I liked how it worked. It's simple, has features I like, and is a strong framework.

# What's next?

Well, I still have to fix some bugs. See the footer down there? It doesn't always show up without scrolling; for example, on the homepage you have to scroll a smidge before you can see it. I also want to add a way to search through tags to see related topics. 

I'll add links to the resources section as I find things, and I'll write other blog posts when I feel like it. But for now, it's functional and I have other work to do so I'll let it sit and come up with more ideas.
