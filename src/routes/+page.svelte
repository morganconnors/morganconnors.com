	<h1>yo, I'm Morgan.</h1>
	<p>I'm a Computer Networking and Cybersecurity student at Champlain College. I currently work at the Leahy Center for Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics where I work to pull user data & firmware from IoT devices.</p>
	<p>I have been a member of the Champlain College <a href="https://www.nationalccdc.org">CCDC</a> team since 2023 and participate in the Champlain Cybersecurity Club and Digital Forensics Association.</p>
	<p>Much of my work is kept private but I plan to start working on some of my projects publicly soon (written 2024-09-27). If you'd like to see what I'm working on, check out my <a href="https://www.github.com/morganconnors/">Github</a>.</p>
